## Description

**probDE** is a fast and flexible Python front-end library with a Fortran/C++ back-end that uses [probabilistic numerics](http://probabilistic-numerics.org/) to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs).  That is, most ODE solvers (such as [Euler's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method)) produce a deterministic approximation to the ODE on a grid of size `delta`.  As `delta` goes to zero, the approximation converges to the true ODE solution.  Probabilistic solvers such as **probDE** also output a solution an a grid of size `delta`; however, the solution is random.  Still, as `delta` goes to zero, the probabilistic numerical approximation converges to the true solution.

**probDE** implements the probabilistic solver of [Chkrebtii et al (2016)](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ba/1473276259). This begins by putting a [Gaussian process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process) prior on the ODE solution, and updating it sequentially as the solver steps through the grid. The user-facing interface is written in Python to allow for a wide appeal. The back-end is a time-varying Kalman filter implemented in C++ and Fortran using state-of-the-art linear algrebra routines found [here](https://github.com/mlysy/kalmantv). **probDE** is 10-40x faster than a pure Python implementation, achieving comparable speeds to the widely-used deterministic solver **odein** in the **Scipy** library. 

## Installation

Download the repo from GitHub and then install with the `setup.py` script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mlysy/probDE.git
cd probDE
pip install .
```

## Usage

Please see the detailed example in the tutorial [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mlysy/probDE/blob/master/probDE/Examples/tutorial.ipynb).  Running the tutorial compares the deterministic Euler solver to the probabilistic solver for the ODE initial value problem

```
x_t^{(2)} = sin(2t) - x_t^{(0)}
x_0^{(1)} = 0
x_0^{(0)} = -1
```

The results for N = 50, 100, and 200 grid points for both solvers is shown below.

**probDE** is also capable of performing parameter inference. An example of this is on the **FitzHugh-Nagumo** model in the tutorial. A comparison of the deterministic Euler solver to the probabilistic solver is shown below.

## Unit Testing

The unit tests are done against the deterministic ode solver **odeint** to ensure that the solutions are approximately equal.
```bash
cd probDE
cd tests
python -m unittest discover -v
```
